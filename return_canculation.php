    <h3>1. What if I want to cancel the project after paying 5% booking amount?</h3>
    <p>We're sorry to see you go. However, the booking amount is non-refundable.</p>

    <h3>2. What if I want to change the design once the order is confirmed?</h3>
    <p>We understand that! You can reach out to your Designer within 24 hours of order confirmation to make any changes. After 24 hours, we would not be able to accommodate any changes.</p>

    <h3>3. What if I didn't like the final product delivered and want to change it?</h3>
    <p>We're sorry to say, but the final product can only be replaced—not changed—in case it is damaged. If this happens, we will replace it absolutely free of cost.</p>
